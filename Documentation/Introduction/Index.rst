Release management
==================

This extension uses `semantic versioning`_ which basically means for you, that

*  Bugfix updates (e.g. 1.0.0 => 1.0.1) just includes small bug fixes or
   security relevant stuff without breaking changes.
*  Minor updates (e.g. 1.0.0 => 1.1.0) includes new features and smaller tasks
   without breaking changes.
*  Major updates (e.g. 1.0.0 => 2.0.0) breaking changes which can be
   refactorings, features or bug fixes.

The changes between the different versions can be found in the
:ref:`changelog <changelog>`.
